# Searching Algorithms

This directory contains algorithm solutions for searching problems implemented in TypeScript using Deno notebooks.

## Notebooks

- **[binary_search.ipynb](binary_search.ipynb)** - Implementation of binary search algorithm on sorted arrays

## Common Searching Problems Covered

- Binary search on sorted arrays
- Search algorithms for finding elements in data structures
- Time complexity analysis of search operations
- Edge cases and boundary conditions in searching

## Setup

To run these notebooks, make sure you have Deno and Jupyter set up as described in the [main README](../README.md).
