# Sorting Algorithms

This directory contains algorithm solutions for sorting problems implemented in TypeScript using Deno notebooks.

## Notebooks

- **[insert_sort.ipynb](insert_sort.ipynb)** - Implementation of insertion sort algorithm
- **[select_sort.ipynb](select_sort.ipynb)** - Implementation of selection sort algorithm

## Common Sorting Problems Covered

- Insertion sort implementation and analysis
- Selection sort implementation and analysis
- Comparison of different sorting algorithms
- Time and space complexity analysis
- In-place sorting techniques
- Stable vs unstable sorting algorithms

## Setup

To run these notebooks, make sure you have Deno and Jupyter set up as described in the [main README](../README.md).
