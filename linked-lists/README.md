# Linked Lists

This directory contains algorithm solutions for linked list problems implemented in TypeScript using Deno notebooks.

## Notebooks

- **[add_two_numbers.ipynb](add_two_numbers.ipynb)** - Solution for adding two numbers represented as linked lists
- **[ch_1_add_two_numbers.ipynb](ch_1_add_two_numbers.ipynb)** - Alternative implementation of adding two numbers
- **[ch_2_remove_nth_node_from_end_of_list.ipynb](ch_2_remove_nth_node_from_end_of_list.ipynb)** - Solution for removing the nth node from the end of a linked list

## Common Linked List Problems Covered

- Adding numbers represented as linked lists
- Removing nodes from specific positions
- Two-pointer techniques for linked lists
- Linked list manipulation and traversal

## Setup

To run these notebooks, make sure you have Deno and Jupyter set up as described in the [main README](../README.md).
